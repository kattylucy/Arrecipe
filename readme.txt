Currently working on the app. This is for friends and family to share their recipes idea.

You can check the app in the following domain

https://www.arrecipe.app/

Why arrecipe?
As a foodie, my friends, family and I had a instagram group in which we share recipes and ideas we saw while scrolling in our freetime, but after a while, we had so many videos saved and barely made any, because it was hard to find with the thousands of messages. I decided to create arrecipe so it was easier to search, we now use the app daily to check our dinner options.
